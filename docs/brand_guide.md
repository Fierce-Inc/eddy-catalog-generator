Stella Reed (Minnesota prairie dreamer) and Maya Carter (Boston harbor adventurer) met under a rain‑spattered awning at Seattle’s Ballard Farmers Market. Sharing laughs over soggy tote bags and the challenge of finding clothes that felt good, looked sharp, *and* honored the planet, they sketched their first ideas on a napkin—vowing to build a brand where style, sustainability, and body positivity walk hand‑in‑hand. Today, Fierce Evergreen Apparel outfits eco‑conscious customers from morning coffee runs to evening gallery strolls.
