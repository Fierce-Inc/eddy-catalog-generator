## 3. Founding Story  
**Isolde Maren**, descended from a lineage of European glass artisans, grew up among shimmering Venetian chandeliers and stained-glass ateliers. For her, light has always symbolized beauty, transformation, and storytelling.  

**Danielle Brooks**, a New York fashion buyer and practical entrepreneur, built her career forecasting trends and understanding what ambitious women demand in their wardrobes.  

The two met during a late-night lecture at The Met, debating whether luxury could exist without illusion. Isolde believed in luminous beauty as universal language; Danielle believed in pragmatic business models that made beauty attainable without compromise. From that spirited exchange, **Vera Lux** was born — a house devoted to truth-infused glamour: luminous, fierce, and ethically grounded.
